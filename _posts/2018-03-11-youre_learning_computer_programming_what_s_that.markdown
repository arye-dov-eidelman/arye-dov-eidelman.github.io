## why is it so hard to explain what computer programming is to the average joe? And Why You Must Experience Software At Least Once In Your Lifetime.

There are so many ways to answer this question, but most aren't satisfying answers. I'll soon tell you why. but first, some popular answers

Now watch it again and try to find one good answer to explain to your friend, who doesn't know the first thing about computer programming what it actually is.

Here is a summary of some of the answers:

1. Programming is basically explaining to a computer what you want it to do for you. - narrator

2. When you're programming you're teaching possibly the stupidest thing in the entire universe - a computer - how to do something - Gabe Newell

3. Programming is one of the only things in the world that you can do, where you can sit down and just make something completely new from scratch, whatever you want - Mark Zuckerberg
 
4. It's not unlike kind of playing an instrument or playing a sport. it starts out being very intimidating, but you kind of get the hang of it over time - Drew Houston

5. Coding is something that can be learned. I know it can be intimidating, a lot of things are intimidating, but you know, what isn't - Chris Bosh

6. A lot of the coding that people do is simple it's more about the process of breaking down problems than coming up with complicated algorithms as people traditionally think about it - Makinde Adeagbo

Most of the answers are either beating around the bush or oversimplified to the extent that they don't help anyone, hence the second half of the video describing the power, awesomeness and creative aspect of computer programming. 

I'm going to suggest that the reason it's so hard to answer the question is for it's like trying to explain to a deaf person what music is, or a blind person what art is. No matter what you tell them they won't understand until they hear the music or see the art.

What would that mean with regards to Computer Programming? take a crash course on computer programing to find out what it actually is. ðŸ™‚
