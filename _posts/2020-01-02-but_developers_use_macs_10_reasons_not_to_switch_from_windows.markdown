### First a disclaimer

If your already familiar with Mac OS this does not apply to you.
If you're familiar with Linux desktops some of these things don't apply to you, as Linux comes in all flavors some more like mac and some more like windows with most being a mix of the two.

## Some background

I started developing on windows. It worked great for the little C# and PHP I tried out before starting at Flatiron School. I continued using it until I got to my first ruby project when I set up some local VM's and eventually switched to WSL. A little bit later I made the complete switch to Ubuntu.
I've now been trying a "mid" 2012 MacBook Pro (I7 + SSD + 16GB RAM).
So have in mind that your mileage may vary if you have less of a windows background. Specifically coding on windows background.

1. Want to see hidden files? NO.

1. Want to go up one directory in the finder? Google might find some 10 ways to go up one directory in finder article but none of the mare as easy clicking the up arrow.

1. Want to scroll the mouse the traditional direction it's been done since apple "invented" it and use the trackpad normally? NO. btw if you choose to have it scroll the traditional mouse way the three-finger gesture window switcher will be backwards as well.

1. Want to close an app, just click the tiny exit button right? NO, it'll just close the window, not the app. That means it'll still get in your way when task switching. Think alt-tabbing between two closed apps while staying on the empty desktop and the app you're looking for is the third or fourth most recent one after the apps you just "closed"

That leads to the next thing. There is no window management.

1. Alt-Tab is an application switcher, not a window switcher. that might sound the same at first, but it means that if you have two windows from the same application open, it won't switch between them. and if you "exit" a <del>app</del> window the app is still open and in your way.

--------

### Can I speak about window management without mentioning window-snapping / screen-splitting. The innovating feature apple just added to iPad OS,  windows had for 10 years, and is still missing from Mac OS.

1. The feature that makes having multiple windows support useful, so you can use (at least) two windows side by side, without them overlapping,  half your screens real estate ending up blank or fiddling with the window edges.

  Steps two split two apps across your screen:

  * On windows:
    1. Drag the title bar of any window to the right or left edge of the screen for half screen. 
    1. You'll get suggestions for other windows to place in the remaining space (only on windows 10). 

  On Windows 10 you can also snap to the corners for up to four windows.


  * On mac
    1. remove both of the windows from fullscreen making sure not to hide one behind the other if they are from the same application (probably your browser)
    1. Hover over the green fullscreen button. (yes hover, not left click for some odd reason.)
    1. Select "Tile window two the left (or right) of the screen".
    1. select the other window to go adjacent to it.
    1. If you forgot to remove the other window from fullscreen in step one, start over from step one.
    1. Oh, and one more thing. if you want to change one of the two windows you'll need to start over again as well.

----------

1. And last but not least remember that all your keyboard shortcuts will change. On windows, the windows key is used for os shortcuts. and the control (ctrl) key is used for application shortcuts. On Mac OS, I still haven't figured it out.
